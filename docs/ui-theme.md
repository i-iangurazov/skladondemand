UI Palette

- Primary: `#F85270` (`primary`) for main CTAs, focus accents, links; foreground on primary uses white.
- Destructive: `#DC143B` (`destructive`) for errors and irreversible actions.
- Brand tint: `#F6CAC9` (`brandTint`) for subtle highlights, chips, or selected rows (use low opacity/borders).
- Warn tint: `#FCEAD0` (`warnTint`) for gentle warning callouts and toasts.
- White-first: backgrounds and cards stay white/neutral; colors appear in accents, borders, and small surfaces. Focus rings use `primary` with opacity (e.g., `ring-primary/40`).
